<h1>Module 3: Portfolio Research</h1>


<h3>What You'll Learn</h3>

<p>Understanding the purpose, audience, and conventions of a web site is essential design process, and it is difficult to arrive at this understanding without doing some research. In this module you will develop your research skills and interview a graduate of either the Professional Writing undergraduate degree or the Digital Rhetoric and Professional Writing graduate program about their personal portfolios and (when applicable) what they look for in portfolios of people applying for jobs.</p>



<h3>What You'll Produce</h3>

<p>You will produce a report of your interview in which you include the questions you asked your interview subject, their answers, and an analysis of what you learned. You'll upload your reports to your Github repo and link to it from your course homepage</p>


<h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>

<ol>


	<li><strong>Develop your interview questions.</strong> Build your list of questions, using our in-class conversation as a starting point. Remember that you are trying to understand what portfolios do, the choices your interviewee made when building theirs, what they learned in building their portfolios and what they might wish they'd known when they were in your shoes. Remember the criteria that Dr. Laura Julier discussed in class.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Contact your interviewee.</strong> This may take time, so reach out to your subject immediately. Remember that they are doing you a favor and be accommodating to their schedule. Ask in what format they would like to participate - email, phone, Skype, in-person, etc.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Get your answers.</strong> Be sure to transcribe responses if your interview is conducted in a way that one isn't generated automatically (e.g. email).</li>
	
	<li><strong>Synthesize your responses.</strong> Summarize what you took away from your interview, including the major points and ideas that you a) want to report back to the class, and 2) will use when you start to design your own portfolio.</li>
		
	<li><strong>Write your report.</strong> Be sure to include a complete list of questions you asked, responses you received, and your synthesis.</li>
			
	<li><strong>Save your report as a .pdf.</strong> Put your completed report in your course page's repo on Github and update your course page to link to it.</li>
