<h1>Module 9: Working with Images</h1>


<h3>What You'll Learn</h3>

<p>You will learn how images work in general and on the web. You'll learn about resolution and the differences between print and web. You'll also learn how images display in a web browser and you'll learn about the different formats of images used on the web.</p>



<h3>What You'll Produce</h3>

<p>You will begin with a full-sized image taken from a digital camera that is of an idea size for printing and you will resize that image appropriately and save it as a new file that is optimized to work for the web. You will also produce a header image for your portfolio site that utilizes type and transparency.</p>


<h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>

<ol>


	<li><strong>Have a print-quality photo of yourself ready.</strong> Locate an image of yourself (or an image you might want to use for your portfolio, if you don't want to use a picture of yourself) that has been taken with a digital camera. Note that this image must be straight from the camera and optimized for print - it cannot be an image saved from Facebook.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Use your image editor to resize the image.</strong> In whatever image editor you choose (we'll use Photoshop in class), resize the image to be no wider than 250 pixels (height should be proportional to the original). </li>
	
	<li><strong>Save the resized image as a new, web-optimized file.</strong> Be sure to save your photo as a new file and not overwrite the original. If you're using Photoshop, be sure to use the File > Save for Web and Devices ... option to optimize your photo for the web (and be sure to save the photo as a .jpg file).</li>
	
	<li><strong>Create a header image for your portfolio using Photoshop.</strong> Create a new image that is 960 x 100 pixels (you can vary this - especially the height - if you don't like the size). Create the header image for your portfolio using the text tool and any text effects you like. Add more elements if you like. Save the layered .PSD.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Save the header image as a new, web-optimized file.</strong>  Using File > Save for Web and Devices ... option in Photoshop to save the new image for the web. Save the header as a .PNG file and be sure to keep the image's transparency intact.</li>

	<li><strong>Upload your work to your AFS space or Github.</strong>  Upload the four files you worked with (the original photo, the web-optimized photo .JPG, the .PSD of the header, and the .PNG saved from the header) to your AFS space or Github and link to each file from your course homepage. </li>

</ol>
