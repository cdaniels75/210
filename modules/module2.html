<h1>Module 2: CRAP Analysis</h1>


<h3>What You'll Learn</h3>

<p>You will use the CRAP framework to analyze the design of a website. Specifically, you will examine how the PW/DRPW alum that you will be interviewing for Module 3 used the CRAP principles (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity) in the design of their portfolio or where the principles might be applied more effectively. If your interview subject does not have a portfolio, you will choose an alum to analyze from the <a href="http://wrac.msu.edu/professional-writing/portfolio/">WRAC Department's website</a>.</p>



<h3>What You'll Produce</h3>

<p>You will detail your findings in a short report. You will save this report as a Word document, which you will upload to your AFS space and link to from your course homepage. If you're feeling particularly generous, you will share your report with the designer of the site you analyzed (researchers should almost always share their conclusions with their interview subjects).</p>


<h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>

<ol>


	<li><strong>Analyze your subject's website using the CRAP principles.</strong> Pay particular attention to how their site works globally (do elements repeat themselves across pages, is the header in sync with the footer, etc.) but you also want to evaluate individual pages of the site.</li>
	
	<li><strong>In a Word document, respond to each of the following:</strong>
	
		<ol>
			<li>Identify at least one instance of the four CRAP principles on the site.</li>
			<li>Choose one aspect of the site's graphic design that you find visually appealing. Analyze this using CRAP - why is it pleasing? What choices did the designer make that make it pleasing?</li>
			<li>Repeat step B, but identify the feature you find least appealing, and discuss how the designer could use CRAP principles to improve it.</li>
			<li>If you were to mimic or replicate one aspect of your alum's design on your own portfolio, what would it be and why?</li>
			<li><em>Remember:</em> be constructive in your criticism. Respond as if the subject will see your report (which they should!)</li>
		</ol>
	
	</li>
	
	<li><strong>Save your Word document as a .pdf</strong> Name the file <em>module2.pdf</em> and upload it to your AFS space so that it sits in the web folder and can be accessed on the Internet.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Update your course page with a link to the new file.</strong> Add a list item to your page that contains a link to this file.</li>
		

</ol>
